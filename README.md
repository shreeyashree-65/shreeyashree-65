## Greetings, fellow developer.
If you find something impressive here, that makes two of us.

# I am Shreeya P S,

-Learning and building at the crossroads of Web3 & AIML. 

-Kinda obsessed with the idea of a user-owned **data**, decentralized web.

-Wiling to create technology that leaves a lasting and meaningful mark on the world.


**Currently focused on:**
- Learning Data Analysis + ML algorithms
- Building AI models, LLMs, and agents that hopefully behave.
- Exploring blockchain and making tiny decentralized things that actually work.

**I’m looking forward to working on:**
- solving real-world problem with data science and machine learning.
- Smart Contract logic, dApps, and distributed backend systems.
- Experimenting with LLM reasoning abilities, designing RAG pipelines, Building AI agents,  and exploring advanced LLM architectures or integrations.

**Fun facts:**
- I enjoy content writing, cuz speaking all of it will be too much for the society.
- My kind of therapy? Calligraphy and zero appointments.
- Once obsessed with watercolor and painting, now I color-code my life.
- Decentralization is literally my jam.
- I study business strategy for fun, figuring out why things succeed or spectacularly fail.
- Hanging out with peeps (especially the nerdy delulus) is my favorite way to discover new ideas and occasionally new food spots. #deluluistheonlysolulu

Careful while exploring! some repos are stable meanwhile others are just random adrenaline experiences.
